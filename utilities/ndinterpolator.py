    RBF ndinterpolator
    ======================

    Module focused on the implementation of the Radial Basis Functions
    interpolation technique.  This technique is still based on the use of
    a set of parameters, the so-called control points, as for FFD, but RBF
    is interpolatory. Another important key point of RBF strategy relies in
    the way we can locate the control points: in fact, instead of FFD where
    control points need to be placed inside a regular lattice, with RBF we
    havo no more limitations. So we have the possibility to perform localized
    control points refiniments.

    :Theoretical Insight:
        As reference please consult M.D. Buhmann, Radial Basis Functions,
        volume 12 of Cambridge monographs on applied and computational
        mathematics. Cambridge University Press, UK, 2003.  This implementation
        follows D. Forti and G. Rozza, Efficient geometrical parametrization
        techniques of interfaces for reduced order modelling: application to
        fluid-structure interaction coupling problems, International Journal
        of Computational Fluid Dynamics.
        
        RBF shape parametrization technique is based on the definition of a map
        :math:`\\mathcal{M}(\\boldsymbol{x}) : \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow
        \\mathbb{R}^n`, that allows the possibility of transferring data across
        non-matching grids and facing the dynamic mesh handling. The map
        introduced is defines as follows
        
        .. math::
            \\mathcal{M}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = p(\\boldsymbol{x}) + 
            \\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathcal{N}_C} \\gamma_i
            \\varphi(\\| \\boldsymbol{x} - \\boldsymbol{x_{C_i}} \\|)
        
        where :math:`p(\\boldsymbol{x})` is a low_degree polynomial term,
        :math:`\\gamma_i` is the weight, corresponding to the a-priori selected
        :math:`\\mathcal{N}_C` control points, associated to the :math:`i`-th
        basis function, and :math:`\\varphi(\\| \\boldsymbol{x} -
        \\boldsymbol{x_{C_i}} \\|)` a radial function based on the Euclidean
        distance between the control points position :math:`\\boldsymbol{x_{C_i}}`
        and :math:`\\boldsymbol{x}`. A radial basis function, generally, is a
        real-valued function whose value depends only on the distance from the
        origin, so that :math:`\\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\tilde{\\varphi}(
        \\|\\boldsymbol{x} \\|)`.

        The matrix version of the formula above is:
        
        .. math::
            \\mathcal{M}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{c} +
            \\boldsymbol{Q}\\boldsymbol{x} +
            \\boldsymbol{W^T}\\boldsymbol{d}(\\boldsymbol{x})
        
        The idea is that after the computation of the weights and the
        polynomial terms from the coordinates of the control points before and
        after the deformation, we can deform all the points of the mesh
        accordingly. Among the most common used radial basis functions for
        modelling 2D and 3D shapes, we consider Gaussian splines, Multi-
        uadratic biharmonic splines, Inverted multi-quadratic biharmonic
        splines, Thin-plate splines, Beckert and Wendland :math:`C^2` basis all
        defined and implemented below.
